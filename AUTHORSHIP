# Authorship and Attribution

## Documentation Authorship

**Important Note:** The documentation files in this repository (including research design frameworks, methodology templates, workflow structures, and planning documents) were **drafted by Anthropic's Claude AI** based on collaborative conversations about my research project.

### Clarification of Authorship

**What Claude Generated:**
- All markdown template files in `/work/` directory
- Research design process documentation in `/planning/`
- Methodology frameworks and structural templates
- Workflow guides and checklists
- Folder organization and file structure documentation

**The Language Used:**
The written articulation, phrasing, sentence structure, and prose style in these planning documents is **Claude's language, not my original writing**. These documents represent AI-generated text based on our iterative discussions.

### My Original Contributions

**What Is Mine:**
- ✓ The research question and topic selection
- ✓ Choice to focus on gap analysis methodology
- ✓ Decision to examine the Kerala HC judgment as catalyst
- ✓ All substantive legal analysis and case reading (to be conducted)
- ✓ All original writing in the final research paper
- ✓ Critical evaluation and decision-making throughout
- ✓ Selection of sources to analyze
- ✓ Interpretation of findings
- ✓ Policy recommendations and conclusions

**What These AI-Generated Documents Represent:**
- Structured scaffolding for organizing my research process
- Reference material and methodological guidance
- Templates to fill with my own analysis and findings
- Documentation of the project planning and development process
- Frameworks to adapt based on my actual research experience

### Purpose and Use of AI-Generated Templates

I am using these Claude-generated documents as:

1. **Planning Infrastructure:** Systematic frameworks to organize a complex research project
2. **Methodological Guidance:** Templates showing best practices for legal research documentation
3. **Work-in-Progress Scaffolding:** Structures that will be filled with my own research, analysis, and writing
4. **Process Documentation:** Record of how the research project was conceptualized and planned
5. **Learning Tools:** Examples of systematic research methodology and documentation practices
