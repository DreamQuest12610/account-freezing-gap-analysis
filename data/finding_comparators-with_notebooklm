# International References in RBI Guidelines

## Master Direction on KYC:
- Section X cites: [Country/body]
- Based on: [Which international standards?]
- References to: FATF? Basel Committee? Other?

## Fraud Risk Management Direction:
- [Same analysis]
```

### Phase 2: Identify What to Compare (Day 4)

**After reading Indian sources, ask:**

1. **What specific problems need solutions?**
   - Authority gap → Need: Clear authorization framework
   - Time limit gap → Need: Maximum duration provisions
   - Notice gap → Need: Procedural requirements

2. **Who handles similar problems well?**
   - Google Scholar search: "bank account freezing regulation [country]"
   - Look at RBI's own references
   - Check: FATF (Financial Action Task Force) recommendations
   - Check: Basel Committee guidelines

3. **Practical constraints:**
   - Must be in English (or have English translations)
   - Must be accessible online
   - Must be recent (post-2015)

### Phase 3: Strategic Comparative Research (Day 5)

**Don't aim for comprehensive comparison.** Aim for **illustrative comparison**:

**Pick 2-3 jurisdictions maximum:**
- **One** with comprehensive framework (probably UK or Singapore)
- **One** culturally/legally similar (maybe Malaysia or Hong Kong)
- **Maybe one** aspirational (like how India might model itself)

## Using NotebookLM for This (Smart Idea!)

**Yes! NotebookLM's deep research is PERFECT for this. Here's how:**

### Stage 1: Let NotebookLM Find Comparators

**Upload to NotebookLM:**
1. Kerala HC judgment PDF
2. The 2-3 RBI circulars you've read
3. Any Indian academic papers on banking regulation (if you find them)

**Ask NotebookLM:**
```
"Based on these documents, which countries or international 
bodies are referenced regarding bank account freezing or 
suspicious transaction management? List all mentions of 
foreign regulatory frameworks or international standards."
```

**Then ask:**
```
"What specific regulatory gaps or problems do these Indian 
documents identify? For each gap, what kind of international 
model or solution might address it?"
```

### Stage 2: Use NotebookLM's Deep Research

**Once you know which countries to explore:**

**Create a new NotebookLM notebook: "International Comparison"**

**Use Deep Research mode with queries like:**
```
"What are the UK Financial Conduct Authority's specific 
requirements for banks to freeze accounts due to suspected 
fraud? Include notice requirements, time limits, and 
accountability mechanisms."
```
```
"Compare Singapore MAS and UK FCA regulations on suspicious 
account freezing. What are the key procedural safeguards?"
```
```
"What are international best practices (FATF or Basel 
Committee) regarding bank authority to freeze accounts 
without court orders?"
