# Gap Analysis: Account Freezing in Cyber Crime Cases

A systematic legal research project examining regulatory voids in India's framework for proactive account freezing by banks.

## 📋 Project Overview

This research analyzes the gap between existing RBI guidelines and actual requirements for banks to freeze accounts in suspected cyber crime cases. Catalyzed by Kerala High Court's landmark judgment in WPC 32516/2024, the study proposes a comprehensive regulatory framework.

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. What gaps exist in RBI's guidelines for suspicious account management?
2. How have courts responded to these regulatory voids?
3. What framework should RBI adopt to balance crime prevention and individual rights?

## 📊 Methodology

- **Approach:** Five-dimensional gap analysis
- **Data:** 50+ High Court judgments (2020-2025)
- **Analysis:** Mixed doctrinal and quantitative methods
- **Deliverable:** Proposed RBI Master Direction

For detailed methodology, see [Research Design Process](planning/research_design_process.md)

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **X%** of cases involved freezes without law enforcement requisition
- Average freeze duration: **X days** (range: Y-Z days)
- **X%** of cases explicitly noted regulatory gap
- Kerala HC's 3-month rule addresses temporal gap but other dimensions remain

**For this project, simple approach:**
- `main` branch = stable, complete work
- `working` branch = daily work in progress
- Merge to main at end of each week

---

## Backup Strategy

**Local backups:**
- Weekly: Zip entire folder, store separately
- Cloud: Google Drive/Dropbox sync
- GitHub: Automatic version history

**Critical files to backup immediately:**
- Your case database (CSV/Excel)
- All working documents (markdown files)
- Any code/scripts

---

## File Size Management

**If repository gets too large:**

1. **Don't commit large PDFs:**
   - Add to `.gitignore`
   - Store locally or on cloud
   - Include a README in `/data/pdfs/` explaining where to get them

2. **Compress images:**
   - Charts as PNG (not uncompressed)
   - Diagrams as SVG when possible

3. **Use Git LFS for key PDFs:**
   - Only for essential documents you want versioned
