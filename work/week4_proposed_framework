# PROPOSED RBI MASTER DIRECTION
## Suspicious Account Management and Temporary Freezing

---

## PREAMBLE

**Authority:** 
- Banking Regulation Act, 1949 - Section 35A
- Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 - Section 12AA
- In exercise of powers conferred by...

**Objective:**
This Master Direction provides a comprehensive framework for banks to:
1. Identify and respond to suspicious account operations
2. Balance crime prevention with account holder rights
3. Coordinate effectively with law enforcement agencies
4. Ensure procedural fairness and accountability

**Applicability:**
All Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks, and Cooperative Banks

**Effective Date:** [To be determined]

---

## SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS

### 1.1 Key Terms

**"Suspicious Account Operations"** means:

[Draft your definition based on:]
- What patterns emerged in your cases?
- What did Kerala HC consider suspicious?
- What criteria do UK/Singapore use?

**Your draft:**
```
An account shall be considered to have suspicious operations when:

(a) Transaction volume significantly exceeds declared income/business profile
    [Define "significantly" - 10x? 20x?]

(b) High-value transactions with no apparent economic purpose
    [Define "high-value" - Rs. 10 lakhs? 50 lakhs?]

(c) Rapid movement of funds (in and out within short period)
    [Define "rapid" and "short period" - 48 hours? 7 days?]

(d) Pattern consistent with money mule operations, including:
    - [List specific indicators from your case analysis]

(e) [Add other criteria based on your research]
```

**Rationale for this definition:** [Reference: Cases showing these patterns, international standards]

---

**"Temporary Freeze"** means:

```
A restriction on debit operations in an account, while allowing:
- Continued credits to the account
- Account holder access for viewing
- [Specify exactly what is and isn't allowed]
```

**Distinguish from:**
- Permanent account closure
- Full freeze (no credits or debits)
- KYC non-compliance freeze

---

**"High-Risk Account Pattern"** means:

[Define specific red flags that warrant immediate attention]

```
(a) New account (< 6 months old) with sudden high-value transactions
(b) Declared income < Rs. 5 lakhs but transactions > Rs. 50 lakhs
(c) [Add more based on your case analysis]
```

---

**"Authorized Official"** means:

[Who within bank can order freeze?]

```
For accounts with balance/transaction value:
- Up to Rs. 10 lakhs: Branch Manager
- Rs. 10-50 lakhs: Regional Manager
- Above Rs. 50 lakhs: Zonal Head or above
```

**Rationale:** [Proportionality, prevents arbitrary low-level freezing]

---

### 1.2 Other Relevant Definitions

- **"Account Holder"**: [Define]
- **"Competent Authority"**: [Which law enforcement agencies]
- **"Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND)"**: [Reference]
- **"Cyber Crime Authority"**: [Define jurisdiction-wise]

---

## SECTION 2: AUTHORITY TO FREEZE

**Provision:**

```
2.1.1 A bank MAY temporarily freeze account operations when it has 
      reasonable grounds to believe that the account is being used for:
      
      (a) Proceeds of cyber fraud or financial crime
      (b) Money laundering
      (c) Terrorist financing
      (d) Other offences under [specify relevant acts]

      (c) [Other urgent circumstances]
```
