### Key Phrases to Track

As you read RBI circulars, highlight and note these vague/ambiguous phrases:

- [ ] "Appropriate action" (Clause 59, MD-KYC) - What does this mean exactly?
- [ ] "Enhanced due diligence" - What specific steps?
- [ ] "Suspicious transactions" - Defined where? How?
- [ ] "Money mules" - Identification criteria?
- [ ] "Accessible notice" - What constitutes accessible?
- [ ] "Reasonable opportunity" - How long is reasonable?

**Record location and context for each:**

**Example:**
```
Phrase: "appropriate action"
Location: Master Direction on KYC, Clause 59
Context: "Banks shall take appropriate action, including reporting 
         suspicious transactions to FIU-IND"
Problem: Does not specify if "appropriate action" includes freezing
```

## Part C: Constitutional & Legal Framework (2 hours)

### Indian Constitutional Standards

**Article 300A - Right to Property**
```
Key principle: No person shall be deprived of property save by authority of law

Application to account freezing:
- Is there "authority of law" for bank-initiated freezing?
- What procedural safeguards does Constitution require?
```

**Principles of Natural Justice**
```
Audi alteram partem (hear the other side):
- Does account holder get notice?
- Opportunity to explain?

Nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be judge in own cause):
- Who decides if freeze is justified?
- Is there independent review?
```

**Banking Regulation Act, 1949 - Section 35A**
```
Extract relevant provisions:
- RBI's power to issue directions
- Binding nature on banks
- Scope and limitations
```

**Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002**
```
Section 12AA - Enhanced Due Diligence:
- What does this require?
- Does it authorize freezing?
- Relationship with RBI guidelines?
```
